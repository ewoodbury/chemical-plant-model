# Chemical Plant Model
This project is a computational model of an ammonia plant consisting of a plug-flow reactor, liquid-vapor condenser (separator), and a recycle stream. I also used numerical methods calculated the optimal operating conditions (temperature, pressure, reactor size) given certain constraints.

This project was completed for UC Berkeley's CBE 140: Intro to Process Engineering.
