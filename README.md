# Chemical Plant Model
This project is a computational model of an ammonia plant consisting of a plug-flow reactor, liquid-vapor condenser (separator), and a recycle stream. I used numerical methods to solve for flow rates and calculate the optimal operating conditions (temperature, pressure, reactor size) given certain constraints.

This project was completed for UC Berkeley's CBE 140: Introduction to Process Engineering in Fall 2017.
